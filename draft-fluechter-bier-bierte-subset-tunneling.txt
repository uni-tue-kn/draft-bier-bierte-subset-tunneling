   Extensions to BIER Tree Engineering (BIER-TE) for Large Multicast
                       Domains and 1:1 Protection
          draft-fluechter-bier-bierte-subset-tunneling-latest

Abstract

   BIER-TE extends BIER with tree engineering capabilities and can be
   supported by almost the same hardware.  However, a bitstring in BIER-
   TE hold bits for BFERs and links, which effects that the size of
   supportable networks in terms of BFERs is smaller for BIER-TE than
   for BIER.  While for BIER, subsets can be utilized to improve scaling
   to large multicast domains, this mechanism requires adaptation for
   BIER-TE.  In this document, requirements for BIER-TE subsets are
   defined, a mechanism is described for how BIER-TE packets can reach
   their subsets using tunneling, and 1:1 protection for the entire
   BIER-TE multicast tree is explained.  The concept utilizes egress
   protection for reaching a subset when the ingress BFIR of the subset
   fails.

1.  Introduction

   Bit Index Explicit Replication with Traffic Engineering (BIER-TE) was
   introduced in [RFC9262] as an alternative to BIER multicast, offering
   enhanced capabilities through traffic engineering, or "tree
   engineering" in this context.  In BIER-TE, the forwarding of
   multicast traffic is guided by the BIER-TE header that includes bits
   representing Bit Forwarding Egress Routers (BFERs) and network links.
   As a result, the entire multicast distribution tree is encoded
   directly within the packet header.  This encoding leads to
   scalability challenges, particularly in large network domains which
   are similar as in BIER.  However, BIER-TE encodes more information in
   the bistring and thus scales worse than BIER for large networks.

   BIER-TE inherits the concept of subsets from BIER where the network
   domain can be partitioned into smaller segments.  A BIER-TE subset is
   a partition of the BIER-TE domain with a unique Set Identifier (SI).
   The SI containing the destination BFERs of a packet is indicated in
   the BIER-TE header as a bitstring.  Further, the bitstring addresses
   only links and BFERs in that subset.

   In this document, requirements for BIER-TE subsets are defined, a
   mechanism is described for how BIER-TE packets can reach their
   subsets using tunneling.  Further the application of 1:1 protection
   for the entire multicast tree is explained.  With these extensions,
   BIER-TE can scale to large multicast domains.  The extensions depend
   on well established technologies and do not require any changes to
   the BIER header or forwarding logic.

2.  BIER-TE Subsets

   In this section, limitations of the current BIER-TE subset definition
   are described.  Based on these shortcomings, a new BIER-TE subset
   concept is proposed.

2.1.  Need for BIER-TE Subsets

   BIER subsets can be constructed by arbitrarily selecting BFERs in the
   domain.  The BIER BFIR can always reach any BFER, no matter which
   subset they are located in.  This does not hold for BIER-TE subsets
   as the BIER-TE header also encodes the links to traverse in the
   bitstring.  Therefore, the BFERs in a subset have to be sufficiently
   connected by links in the same subset.  BFIRs that are not part of
   such a subset cannot send packets to the BFERs in the subset
   directly.  Rather, they have to tunnel packets to a BFR in the subset
   which then applies BIER-TE forwarding again.

2.2.  Subsets for BIER-TE

   The following constraints MUST be fullfilled by BIER-TE subsets.  A
   BIER-TE subset MUST be at least one-connected, i.e., there has to be
   at least one path from any BFR to any BFER in the subset.  Further,
   the combined number of BFERs and links in a subset MUST NOT be larger
   than the maximum supported BitStringLength.  There is also the
   posbility that a one-connected domain does not contain suitable one-
   connected subsets.  To solve this, tunnels can be assigned as virtual
   links in the subset.  These tunnels leverage the routing layer and
   may forward the packet over links that are not in the subset.

   Every BFR that can reach any BFER in a subset over links of the
   subset is considered a part of the subset.  These BFRs may serve as
   ingress nodes for the subset and tunneling endpoints to deliver
   packets to the BFERs of a subset.  BFRs that receive tunneled packets
   from a BFIR are referred to as Subset BFIRs (S-BFIR).

2.3.  Subsets for BIER-TE with 1:1 Protection

   Subsets for BIER-TE with 1:1 protection have to be at least two-
   connected, i.e., there have to be at least two paths from any BFR to
   any BFER in the subset.  When a link or node failes, the remaining
   subset is still one-connected.  Further, for every S-BFIR in the
   subset, one or more backup S-BFIRs have to be assigned.  When an
   S-BFIR fails, the backup S-BFIRs serve as alternative ingress to the
   subset and ensure that the packets reach the BFERs.

3.  Subset Tunneling

   The BFIR reaches each subset by tunneling packets to any S-BFIR in
   the subset.  To that end, the BFIR forwarding logic has to be
   slightly modified from the one defined in [RFC8279].  When a BFIR
   receives an IPMC packet, it determines the destination BFERs and
   their subsets as with standard BIER-TE.  The BFIR clones the packet
   for each subset and adds the corresponding BIER-TE header to each
   packet.  The BIER-TE bitstring contains the multicast tree from
   S-BFIR to the BFERs in the same subset.  Then, the BFIR adds an outer
   tunneling header that reaches one of the S-BFIRs of the destination
   subset.

       Figure 1: Example BIER-TE network with a one-connected BIER-TE
                      subset, S-BFIR, and MPLS tunnel.

   When an S-BFIR receives such a tunneled packet, it removes the tunnel
   header and applies BIER-TE forwarding.  Used tunneling protocols
   SHOULD support traffic engineering, e.g., MPLS TE or SRv6.  Further,
   they SHOULD support FRR and egress protection mechanisms for 1:1
   protection.

4.  1:1 Protection

   The protection of BIER-TE with subsets is split into three sections:
   during tunneling, at the subset ingress, and within the subset.

4.1.  Subset Tunneling Protection

   The tunnel between BFIR and S-BFIR may be protected using existing
   FRR 1:1 protection mechanisms.  RSVP-TE with FRR [RFC8796] can be
   used for MPLS and [I-D.draft-ietf-rtgwg-segment-routing-ti-lfa] for
   FRR protection in SRv6.

4.2.  Subset Ingress Protection

   When an S-BFIR fails, the packet has to be rerouted to a backup
   S-BFIR.  To protect against this failure, the tunneling protocol must
   support an egress protection mechanism.  If MPLS is used for the
   tunnel, then the MPLS Egress Protection Framework [RFC8679] can be
   used.  For SRv6 egress protection there is a similar draft
   [I-D.draft-ietf-rtgwg-srv6-egress-protection].

   When the penultimate tunneling hop detects the failure of the S-BFIR,
   it becomes the PLR.  On a detected failure, the PLR determines a
   backup S-BFIR of the same subset.  If there are multiple backup
   S-BFIR, the PLR may select a backup S-BFIR based on different
   criteria, e.g., the closest backup S-BFIR.  The PLR uses the egress
   protection mechanism of the tunneling protocol to reroute the packet
   to the backup S-BFIR.

        / ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄA‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ S-BFIR ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ0‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ \
       /         (Backup)         \

               Figure 2: Example subset with a backup S-BFIR.

   The backup S-BFIR recognizes its role as backup ingress based on the
   tunneling protocol header.  It removes the tunneling header and
   applies BIER-TE FRR [I-D.draft-eckert-bier-te-frr] with node
   protection.  This ensures that the packet is forwarded to the correct
   next hops of the failed S-BFIR.  It also modifies the BIER-TE
   bitstring to prevent loops in the subset.  After the backup S-BFIR
   processing, standard BIER-TE forwarding is applied.

4.3.  Intra-Subset Protection

   Protection against failure inside a subset is achieved with existing
   BIER-TE FRR mechanisms.  There are currently two drafts for BIER-TE
   FRR [I-D.draft-eckert-bier-te-frr] and [I-D.draft-chen-bier-te-frr].
   Both define mechanisms for link and node protection and propose BIER-
   TE-in-BIER-TE tunneling to reroute packets around a failure.
   Therefore, either of these drafts may be used for the FRR protection
   mechanisms.

5.  Examples

   In this section, we present two exemplary scenarios.  One for the
   subset tunneling and one for the ingress protection mechanism.

5.1.  Subset Tunneling

   An example topology using BIER-TE subset tunneling is illustrated in
   Figure 3.  The BFIR determines that the packet needs to be delivered
   to BFERs 1 and 2.  It recognizes that the two BFERs lie within two
   different subsets and clones the packet.  The first packet receives a
   BIER-TE header with the bits set for link 0 and BFER 1 and is
   tunneled to the S-BFIR of subset 1.  The second packet recieves a
   BIER-TE header with the bits set for link 1 and BFER 2 and is
   tunneled to subset 2.  When the packet arrives at each S-BFIR, the
   S-BFIR removes the MPLS tunnel header.  For subset 1, it then matches
   the BIER bitstring and forwards the packet over link 0.  The S-BFIR
   of subset to forwards the packet over link 1.

                   BFER 1                  BFER 2   BFER 3

      Figure 3: Example BIER-TE network with two subsets and S-BFIRs.

5.2.  Ingress Protection with MPLS Tunneling

   Figure 4 illustrates the concept of ingress protection with MPLS.
   When the tunneled BIER-TE packet arrives at the LSR B, it detects
   that S-BFIR A failed.  Using MPLS egress protection, the PLR (LSR B)
   switches the label to the context label C' which indicates the backup
   path to S-BFIR'.  S-BFIR' recognizes its role as protector by
   matching the context label to the failed ingress node.  Then, it
   applies the BIER-TE FRR node protection handling, unsets the bit for
   link 1 and sets the bit for link 0.  This way, the packet reaches the
   BFR and can be forwarded with standard BIER-TE.
